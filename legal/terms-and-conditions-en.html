<h2>2. Business Profile</h2>

<h2>3. Inquiries &amp; Contract Formation</h2>
<p>Information on the Website does not constitute a binding offer. Contracts are concluded individually after an offer is issued and accepted (email/PDF/contract).</p>
<h2>4. Custom-Made Products</h2>
<p>Products marked as CUSTOM are manufactured according to specifications agreed between the parties. Visuals and photos are illustrative.</p>
<h2>5. Delivery Time</h2>
<p>Delivery times, especially for CUSTOM products, are agreed individually and become binding only upon written confirmation and acceptance by both parties (email/PDF/contract).</p>
<h2>6. Deposits &amp; Prepayments</h2>
<p>Order fulfillment may be conditional upon a deposit:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>30%</strong> of the order value – standard projects,</li>
<li><strong>50%</strong> of the order value – higher-value and/or highly customized projects,</li>
</ul>

<h2>9. VAT &amp; Tax Residency</h2>
